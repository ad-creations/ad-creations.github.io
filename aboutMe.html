            Who is Alex Daley?
        </h1>
            <p style="background-color: beige;">
            Born and raised just outside D.C in a place called Arlington,Virginia.
            I enjoy spending my time playing video games when not worrying about school work.
            I also have a strong passion for photography which will be linked on this page if you'd like to check out my portfolio so far uploaded!
            Here at UD you can find me in Lane Hall where I am a RA or behind the little bob practicing ultimate frisbee with my club team.
    
            A fun fact about me would be during my freshman year I was sprayed with a fire extinguisher.... and no I was not on fire.
